	Newfoundlands were originally bred as working dogs for fishermen in Newfoundland, Canada). They are known for their giant size, calm dispositions, strength, and loyalty. With their thick coat, webbed paws, and muscular build, itâ€™s no surprise that Newfoundlands are at home in the water. They excel at swimming, water rescue training, and water games.

	Newfoundland dogs make great family pets, but do require a lot of grooming and should be given space for outdoor activities.
