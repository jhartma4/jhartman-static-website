	<p class="text1">
	German Shepherd Dogs are large dogs that are approximately 22â€“26 inches at the shoulder and weight approximately 66-90 lbs., with males being larger.
	</p>
	<p class="text1">
	They have long muzzles with strong jaws and the eyes are always brown with an intelligent, bright, and self-confident gaze. Their ears are large and stand erect, though puppies are born with floppy ears that stand as they grow.
	</p>
	<p class="text1">
	German Shepherds are loyal and highly intelligent dogs that make great companions. Due to their high intelligence and trainability, they are commonly used as police and service dogs.
